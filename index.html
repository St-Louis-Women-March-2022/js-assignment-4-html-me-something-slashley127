               <h2>Bojack</h2>
               <p>Bojack is a nearly 5-year old tuxedo domestic shorthair cat. Nearly 5 years ago a friend of mine found him outside of a dumpster and asked if I would like a kitten.

               <p>If Bojack were not a cat, he would be a fictional mafia boss. He's big, sturdy, and intimidating.

Most of his days are spent sitting in his chair and giving me an uninviting glare (as shown below). </p>

Knowning I have an affinity for tuxedo cats, the animal hospital I used to work at called and asked if I would like a tuxedo kitten from a litter they were taking care of. I  </p>
