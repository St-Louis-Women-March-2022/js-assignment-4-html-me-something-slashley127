               <h2>Bojack</h2>
               <p id="testP">Bojack is a nearly 5-year old tuxedo domestic shorthair cat. Nearly 5 years ago a friend of mine found him outside of a dumpster and asked if I would like a kitten. I, of course, said 'yes.' Bojack is headstrong and stubborn, always getting everything he wants by being aggressively annoying. </p>
               <p>If Bojack were not a cat, he would be a fictional mafia boss. He's big, sturdy, and intimidating. He has immense love for his mother and has taken one of the other cat's under his wing as an apprentice. Bojack will steal food from the other cats and they let him do it. Most of his days are spent sitting in his chair and giving me an uninviting glare (as shown below). </p>

               <a name="Todd"></a>
               <h2>Todd</h2>
               <p>Todd is a 3 year old tuxedo domestic shorthair, named after the pesky, aloof roommate of Bojack from the Netflix original show 'Bojack Horseman.' Knowning I have an affinity for tuxedo cats, the animal hospital I used to work at called and asked if I would like a tuxedo kitten from a litter they were taking care of. I could not turn away a little kitten in need so I took in Todd.</p>
               <p>If he were not a cat, Todd would be an OSHA inspector. Todd is always very concerned about what everyone else is doing and if it meets all required safety protocols. He likes to sleep on top of whoever lays on the couch to insure they do not require assistance while they are asleep. Todd also stands guard in the bathroom while anyone takes a shower to make sure there are no preventable accidents.</p>

               <a name="Gancho"></a>
               <h2>Gancho</h2>
               <p>Gancho is 2 years old and joined my famliy of tuxedo cats when my partner moved in with us. Gancho is a stunning brown tabby domestic shorthair, long and slender in physique. He is best known for being elusive and liking pets only a little bit...but not too much. He has recently become an apprentice to Bojack for the spot of &quot;alpha&quot; Gancho watches Bojack closely and has most recently begun to wake me up in the middle of the night begging for me to shake the food bowl so it covers the entirety of the bottm of the bowl, not just the sides. This is something only Bojack used to do.</p>
               <p>If he were not a cat, Gancho would be a members of the CIA. He is quick and sneaky and always seems to be engaged in some form of training exercise. He practices jumping onto increasingly higher surfaces. His favorite thing to do is climb the support beam in the middle of our bedroom to the top of our lofted ceiling to gain higher perspective for gaining intel. I'm convinced Gancho believes he is being held against his will in captivity and keeps daily journal logs of his attempts to escape. Recently we took him to get his vaccines and I'm sure he thinks we have embedded a tracking device in him. Little does he know we already did that when he was a baby. Despite Gancho's best efforts to remain undomesticated, he seems to increasingly enjoy laying on the couch. I've even caught him making biscuits a few times on an especially fluffy blanket. </p>

               <a name="Linus"></a>
               <h2>Linus</h2>
               <p>Linus is a small fluffy black domestic longhair cat that also joined our family when my partner moved in with me. He is very pretty but there is not a lot of thoughts happening behind those eyes. He is named after Linus from Peanuts because he still suckles on a blanket (most likely a symptom of being removed from his mother too soon). Linus is very loving and sweet although he tends to aggravate Todd frequently just by being present.</p>
               <p>If Linus were not a cat...actually...I'm sometimes not completely sure Linus is a cat. My partner and I are pretty sure he experiences all timelines simultaneously. He appears and disappears seemingly out of thin air and although he seems aloof to us, he might just be a visitor from another dimension doing research. My partner often says he looks like a mage with long flowing robes because of his long fur. He often reminds me of on of those &quot;worm on string&quot; toys and he could very well just be an entity we are unable to comprehend with our puny human brains and eyes, hence why he appears to us as a house cat. All of this aside, Linus is inquisitive and loving and damn adorable. No matter what he is, we still love him.</p>
